It is possible to estimate the latency and throughput of each of the 4 links.
This can be done by using the ping command and finding the delay for the packet
to reach the destination. This time will be the time it takes to move from the
host to the switch, the switch to another switch, and the switch to another host.

Using the command "h1 ping h2", we can find the time it takes to travel along
the link from one host to it's switch. The delay from h1 to h2 is 0.02 ms. This
delay is the delay from h1 to s1 and s1 to h2. So the total delay for a link
from a host to its switch is 0.01 ms. So, the delays from a host to its own switch
is negligible.

L1's latency can be found by pinging h1 to h3. This delay is 80 ms.
L2's latency can be found by pinging h3 to h4. This delay is 20 ms.
L3's latency can be found by pinging h4 to h5. This delay is 40 ms.
L4's latency can be found by pinging h4 to h7. This delay is 60 ms.

The ping command send the packet to the desination, and then the destination
responds back to the source host of the ping command. So the latency is half of
the above delays. So:
L1's Latency = 40 ms.
L2's latency = 10 ms.
L3's latency = 20 ms.
L4's latency = 30 ms.

The iperf command gives the bandwidth between hosts, so the bandwidth of the links
can be found by testing the bandwidth of hosts on either side of a link.

L1's bandwidth = 20 Mbits/sec
L2's bandwidth = 40 Mbits/sec
L3's bandwidth = 30 Mbits/sec
L4's bandwidth = 20 Mbits/sec
